# React Blog

A Simple Markdown to Blog implementation using React

## Base Data Structure

The basic structure of the Data should be an Array containing Objects containing Metadata (for filtering) and the Markdown itself which would then be parsed using [React Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)

It is quite simple and inflexible but hopefully I won't need to expand on this for a while
